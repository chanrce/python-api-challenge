#Project title:

Python API Challenge

##About:

WeatherPy: A data analysis of randomly generated cities around the world and the weather in those locations. How can we prove that temperature increases as we get closer to the equator?

VacationPy: Using the data gathered in WeatherPy, we can determine ideal vacation spots (based on weather) by setting parameters. With this list of ideal city vacation spots, we can search for hotels with the given locations.

##Tech used:

Python, jupyter notebook, pandas, Google Places APIs, 

OpenWeatherMap API, CityPy



##API documentation:
Google:
    -https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview
Open Weather Map:
    -https://openweathermap.org/current


##How to use:
-Open the challenge on jupyter notebook.
-Enter your google and weather api keys into the "keys.py" document.
-Run the WeatherPy and VacationPy files (in that order)
